-----------------

currently I am on branch1 

---------------

$ git push
fatal: The current branch branch1 has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin branch1

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

$ git switch master
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:

Aborting
