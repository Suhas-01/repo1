create a folder 

	git init 

configure the uname and email 

	git config --global user.name "Suhas"
	git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

	git push -u origin master:repo1

			master -- local branch 
			repo1 	- remote branch 
					--- upto here successful.






		create a folder - say folder1 
		open vs code 
		create a file in it -- say file1 
		
		initiate git repo in the folder1.
		
		
		create a github repo --- say repo1 
		
		push this file1 from folder1 to repo1 
		
		
--------------------


	What you should be able to do ----------->>>
	
	
		clone the project 
		
		create a branch for your module --- say branch1 
		
			make your changes in branch1 
			
			merge the branch1 with your LocanMain branch 
			
		switch to the branch1 
		
		push the branch1 to the remote repo 
		
			remote branch1 should get auto created.
			
		your TL or test manager --- 
			
			will create a pull request and will merge the remote branch1 with RemoreMain branch		
			
		Then you and everyone else can pull the code and can update your local main branch to the latest code ............... !! 
		
		
		--------------------------
		
		
		Implement all the above in you personal computer first .......   !!

		Problem I am facing 
		
		
			I have done changes in local branch1 
			
			but I am unable to merge them with local main 
			
			Also I am unable to switch to local main from local branch1 because --- changes in local branch1 are getting lost --- bcz of that ... !! 
			
			----
			
			
		SMALL STEPS ----->>>>
		
		
			clone the project 
			
			pull the changes 
			
			create a duplicate branch with name --- branch1 		--- All fine upto ere 
			
			
			make changes in --- branch1 
			
			merge changes with local main branch ---- facing challenges here ... !! 
			
			---
			
				1 solution --- 
				
					stash the changes in branch1 
					
					
					To merge your local branch1 with the local main branch, follow these steps:

							Switch to the main branch:
							git switch main
							
							Merge branch1 into main:
							git merge branch1
			
					But I am unable to switch to the main branch --- w/o losing the changes in the branch1 
					
							git add .
							git commit -m "Your commit message"

							git switch main

							git merge branch1


					Now, push the branch1 to remote as remote branch1 
					
							git remote 			// to check the remote repo name 
							
							# Assuming 'origin' is the name of your remote repository
							git push -u origin branch1:branch1

													--- successful ... !! 
													
													
					Now, 
						I want to merge my remote branch1 with remote main branch.
						
						How can I do that.
						One way is to do -- pull request.
						
						what is another way ...?
						
						
						One more query 
						
							If I commit branch1 to merge with local main --- and the merge is not proper --- how can I proceed further. 
							
						
						-------------
						
					===========================
					
					I do not need steps to merge the branches locally. I need way to merge the remote branch1 with remote main branch. 
					There should not be any role of local branches in merging these 2 remote branches. 
					
					
					If you want to merge two remote branches without involving local branches, you can use the following command:

					git push origin branch1:main
					This command pushes the changes from the remote branch1 to the remote main branch. Make sure to replace origin with the actual name of your remote repository.

					This assumes that you have the necessary permissions to push changes to the remote repository and that you want to overwrite the main branch with the changes from branch1. 
					Be cautious with this operation, as it can overwrite changes on the remote main branch.
