create a folder 

	git init 

configure the uname and email 

	git config --global user.name "Suhas"
	git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

	git push -u origin master:repo1

			master -- local branch 
			repo1 	- remote branch 
					--- upto here successful.






		create a folder - say folder1 
		open vs code 
		create a file in it -- say file1 
		
		initiate git repo in the folder1.
		
		
		create a github repo --- say repo1 
		
		push this file1 from folder1 to repo1 
		
		
--------------------


	What you should be able to do ----------->>>
	
	
		clone the project 
		
		create a branch for your module --- say branch1 
		
			make your changes in branch1 
			
			merge the branch1 with your LocanMain branch 
			
		switch to the branch1 
		
		push the branch1 to the remote repo 
		
			remote branch1 should get auto created.
			
		your TL or test manager --- 
			
			will create a pull request and will merge the remote branch1 with RemoreMain branch		
			
		Then you and everyone else can pull the code and can update your local main branch to the latest code ............... !! 
		
		
		--------------------------
		
		
		Implement all the above in you personal computer first .......   !!

		Problem I am facing 
		
		
			I have done changes in local branch1 
			
			but I am unable to merge them with local main 
			
			Also I am unable to switch to local main from local branch1 because --- changes in local branch1 are getting lost --- bcz of that ... !! 
			
			----
			
			
		SMALL STEPS ----->>>>
		
		
			clone the project 
			
			pull the changes 
			
			create a duplicate branch with name --- branch1 		--- All fine upto ere 
			
			
			make changes in --- branch1 
			
			merge changes with local main branch ---- facing challenges here ... !! 
			
			---
			
				1 solution --- 
				
					stash the changes in branch1 
					
					
					To merge your local branch1 with the local main branch, follow these steps:

							Switch to the main branch:
							git switch main
							
							Merge branch1 into main:
							git merge branch1
			
					But I am unable to switch to the main branch --- w/o losing the changes in the branch1
